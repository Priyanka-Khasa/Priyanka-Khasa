  Stone Paper Scissors is a simple hand game where two players simultaneously choose one of three options:

 rock, paper, or scissors, with the rule that rock beats scissors,
 
 scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock; 
 
 making it a game of chance where strategy can still play a role by observing your opponent's patterns.
